# Alternateshell Registry key
### Origin of the technique
You can set a shell that is run when you run windows in SafeMode.

### How to achieve persistence
set `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\[AlternateShell]` to your own shell.
### Requirements
Admin privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
Executed when started in safeboot.
Note that is also possible for the attacker to enable SafeMode by default (see source below).
