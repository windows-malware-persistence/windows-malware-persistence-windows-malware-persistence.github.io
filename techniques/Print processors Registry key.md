# Print processors Registry key
### Origin of the technique
Some drivers the are used for printing.

### How to achieve persistence
Create a subkey under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\%ARCHITECTURE%\Print Processors\`, at a subkey called `Driver`, with the  name of the DLL. The architecture is for example `Windows x64`. Place the DLL in `C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRTPROCS\x64`

### Requirements
Administrator privileges are required to write to the registry and to the file. Generic DLL suffices.

### The achieved persistence
Runs at boot, as SYSTEM.
