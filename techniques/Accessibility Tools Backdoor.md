### Origin of the technique
Windows contains multiple accessibility features that enable the use of the operating system by impaired users. These features can be accessed by some hotkeys. By hijacking the executables of the accessibility tools, the malware can execute code when the key combination is pressed.

### How to achieve persistence
Replace accessibility features with a malicious file.

The accessibility tools are the following:
- On-Screen Keyboard: `C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe`
- Magnifier: `C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe`
- Narrator: `C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe`
- Display Switcher: `C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe`
- App Switcher: `C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe`
- Sticky keys: `C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe`
- Utilman: `C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe`


### Requirements
In recent windows versions execution is protected, as the executables have to be signed.
Required Trusted installer privileges to replace the executables.

### The achieved persistence
When the user tries to use one of the accessibility tools, the code is executed. If the tools is opened before the user logs in, the launched process has system privileges.
