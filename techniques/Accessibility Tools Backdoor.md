# Accessibility Tools Backdoor
### Origin of the technique
Windows contains multiple accessibility features that enable the use of the operating system by impaired users. These features can be accessed by some hotkeys. By overwriting the executables of the accessibility tools, the malware can execute code when one of the accessibility tools is launched. Note that these tools can also be launched before loging in.

### How to achieve persistence
Replace accessibility features with a malicious file.

The accessibility tools are the following:
- On-Screen Keyboard: `C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe`
- Magnifier: `C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe`
- Narrator: `C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe`
- Display Switcher: `C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe`
- App Switcher: `C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe`
- Sticky keys: `C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe`
- Utilman: `C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe`


### Requirements
In recent versions of Windows the executables have to be signed.
Required Trusted installer privileges to replace the executables.

### The achieved persistence
When the user tries to use one of the accessibility tools, the code is executed. If the tools is opened before the user logs in, the launched process has system privileges.
