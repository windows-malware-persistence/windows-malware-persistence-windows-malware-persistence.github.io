# Startup folder Registry key
### Origin of the technique
Windows has some folders for which it will execute the contents on log in. You can set the folders in the registry.

### How to achieve persistence
Change one of the following registry keys (name `Startup`, or `CommonStartup` under HKLM) to your own path:

- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`
Place an executable in one of these folders.


### Requirements
If you only want to execute it for the current user, user privileges are enough to place the file and write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
Runs at log in. Downside is that the original startup folder is not run anymore.
