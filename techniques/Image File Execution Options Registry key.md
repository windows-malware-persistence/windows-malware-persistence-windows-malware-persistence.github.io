# Image File Execution Options Registry key
### Origin of the technique
Windows allows for starting a debugger instead of the original exe file. The idea is that the debugger can then launch the original exe file as child.

### How to achieve persistence
Add
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\{name of the executable}`
And add value: `"Debugger"="{full path to the debugger}"`

### Requirements
Administrator privileges are required to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
When the targeted executable is started, the defined 'debugger' is started instead. The same privileges that the original executable would get are given to the 'debugger'.
