# url shortcut
### Origin of the technique
In windows you can create shortcuts to executables. An example are most icons on the desktop.
While the name suggests it can only be used for urls, it can also be used to open executables.
### How to achieve persistence
Change a url link file to either open your own file, or add tags to the execution so it will execute your own code besides the original application.

### Requirements
Only user privileges are required.

### The achieved persistence
The malicious code is executed when the user opens the link file.
