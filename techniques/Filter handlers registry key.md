### Origin of the technique
Windows allows for custom filters (`ifilters`) for files with custom file extensions. When searching in the Windows menu, these filters are applied.

### How to achieve persistence
Register a COM DLL for a file extension.
Then, add the CLSID under `(Default)` in  `HKLM\Software\Classes\.<some extension>\Handler`

### Requirements
Administrator privileges are required to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
When a new file with the extension is created, or when the file shows up in a search, the DLL is executed with System privileges.
