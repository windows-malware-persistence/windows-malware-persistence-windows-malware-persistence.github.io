# RDP startup program Registry key
### Origin of the technique
When connecting to a Windows machine using RDP, Windows will launch rdpclip, which is used for copying between the remote and local machine. We can hijack this program.

### How to achieve persistence
For the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Wds\rdpwd`  set `StartupPrograms` to your executable.

### Requirements
Administrator privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
Runs everytime a RDP connection is made.
