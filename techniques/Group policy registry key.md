### Origin of the technique
You can add logon startup/logon scripts to the group policy.

### How to achieve persistence
The registry paths are
- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy\Scripts\Logon\<id>\<id>`
- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy\Scripts\<id>\<id>`
- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy\State\Machine\Scripts\<id>\<id>`
At the registry key, write:
- `Script`: the executable
- `Parameters`: arguments for the executable

The added items are not visible in the UI.

### Requirements
Admin privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
Runs on startup/logon as system.
