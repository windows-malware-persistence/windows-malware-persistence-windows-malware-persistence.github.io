### Origin of the technique
In windows you can create shortcuts to executables. An example are most icons on the desktop.

### How to achieve persistence
Change a link file to either open your own file, or add tags to the execution so it will execute your own code besides the original application.

### Requirements
Only user privileges are required.

### The achieved persistence
The malicious code is executed when the user opens the link file.
