# PATH Registry key
### Origin of the technique
When running a command from the command line, it looks up the executable through the order of the PATH environment variable.

### How to achieve persistence
Change the `Path` environment variable to include a directory that the you also put an executable in. You can store environment variables in the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment`
or `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`

### Requirements
User privileges to set the registry for the current user.

### The achieved persistence
When cmd or powershell starts the targeted executable, it will start your executable instead.
