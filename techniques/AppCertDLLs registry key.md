### Origin of the technique
The AppCert DLL is loaded by processes that use one of the following API calls: `CreateProcess`, `CreateProcessAsUser`, `CreateProcessWithLoginW`, `CreateProcessWithTokenW`, or `WinExec`. The original functionality of the AppCert DLL is to evaluate the security level of processes started with any of these functions.  

### How to achieve persistence
Place a DLL someplace and add the path to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\`

### Requirements
Administrator privileges.

### The achieved persistence
The resulting persistence has user privileges. Trigger is for example by running a command from PowerShell.
