# Universal App URI Registry key
### Origin of the technique
Windows uses URIs to locate among other Universal apps, such as the Narrator Feedback-Hub.

### How to achieve persistence
When using a Universal App URI, Windows will look for the matching name under `HKCU\Software\Classes\<name (e.g. AppXysdfafajwklf34234lskfnsklf>)\Shell\open\command`.
From this entry, remove the DelegateExecute, and set `(Default)` to an executable with parameters.
Other options are adding a new entry under classes, or changing the `DelegateExecute` to a valid CLSID.

### Requirements
User privileges.

### The achieved persistence
Executes when the URI is resolved and followed. For the example above, it is when the user uses the narrator feedback hub.
