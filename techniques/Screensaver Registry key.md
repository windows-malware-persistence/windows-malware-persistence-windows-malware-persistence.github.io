# Screensaver Registry key
### Origin of the technique
You can set up a custom screensaver in windows.

### How to achieve persistence
Write the following values to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\`:
- `ScreenSaveActive` = `1` (enables the screensaver)
- `SCRNSAVE.EXE` = `path to exe` 
- `ScreenSaveTimeOut` = `5` (time in seconds that the user is inactive before the screensaver is executed).

### Requirements
Only user privileges required.

### The achieved persistence
Runs the executable when the user has been inactive for some time. When the user becomes active again, the process is stopped.
"If screensavers are disabled by group policy, this method cannot be used for persistence."
