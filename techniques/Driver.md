### Origin of the technique
Drivers are used by windows as an interface between hardware functionality and software.

### How to achieve persistence
Use the `ZwLoadDriver` NtDLL call to load a driver. The function takes a registry key as an argument, which should provide all the information about the the driver, including the location of the `.sys` file.

Note that Windows Services can also be used to register drivers at a higher level.
### Requirements
You need to add a registry key with all the information about the driver. The `.sys` driver file should be placed on the system.
Next, you need to call `ZwLoadDriver`.
Of course, you can also overwrite existing drivers in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers`
### The achieved persistence
When the system uses any driver functionality, the attacker can have injected driver code.
