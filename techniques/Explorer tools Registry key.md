# Explorer tools Registry key

### Origin of the technique
Windows has various "explorer" tools that are launched automatically or by some user actions. Some example are the Cleanup tool and the Backup tool.

### How to achieve persistence
By replacing the `(Default)` value of one or multiple of the explorer tools in the registry (under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer`), you can start your own executables instead. The tools we were able to replace are "cleanup", "backup", and "defragmentation". You can also give parameters to the executable.

### Requirements
Administrator rights are required. 

### The achieved persistence
Sometimes executes automatically, otherwise for example when clicking disk cleanup (Under C drive settings).
