# Protocol handler Registry key
### Origin of the technique
When the user clicks special links in the browser (e.g., 'mailto:'), the browser can use a COM object to resolve this request.

### How to achieve persistence
Write the CLSID of a malicious COM object to `HKLM\software\classes\protocols\handler\<name (e.g., mailto)>\[CLSID]`
You can use [[COM hijack]] to create a good COM object.
### Requirements
Admin privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
User privileges. COM object is loaded when the targeted link is clicked.
