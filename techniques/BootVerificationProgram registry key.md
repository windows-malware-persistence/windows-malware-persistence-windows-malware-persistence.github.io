### Origin of the technique
After a successful boot, Winlogon notifies the Service Control Manager (SCM) that the boot was successful. To define a successful boot differently, you can add your own program.

### How to achieve persistence
Create the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\BootVerificationProgram` and set `ImagePath` to your own executable.

### Requirements
Administrator privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
System privileges and runs on every boot.
