### Origin of the technique
The Windows command prompt (cmd) enables the user to set an `autorun` command that is executed when cmd is started.

### How to achieve persistence
Set the value of `Autorun` of the registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\`.
You can also set it for all users under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`.

### Requirements
User privileges suffice. Admin privileges required for the system-wide registry.

### The achieved persistence
When cmd is run, the command is executed first. The privileges depend on with what privileges the user executes the command prompt.
