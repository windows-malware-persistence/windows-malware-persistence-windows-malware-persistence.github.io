### Origin of the technique
Universal Windows Platform apps are a kind of Windows application, distributed using the APPX file format.  These include for example the Cortana app and People app. Universal Windows Platform apps allow to automatically run a debugger when the app is started.

### How to achieve persistence
Add a registry key with a command you want to execute.
Registry keys:
- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PackagedAppXDebug\<some appx app>\` 
- `HKCU\Software\Classes\ActivatableClasses\Package\<some appx app>\DebugInformation\<a specific version based string>.mca` -> `DebugPath` value

### Requirements
User privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
User privileges, when the targeted app is started. Some of them might already start at boot.
