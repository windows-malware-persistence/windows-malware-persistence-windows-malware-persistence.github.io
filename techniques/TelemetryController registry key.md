### Origin of the technique
Windows has some telemetry functions. These are extendable through the registry.

### How to achieve persistence
Add a key to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TelemetryController` and set:
- `Command` to your execuable with arguments
- One or more of `Maintenance`, `Nightly`, `Oobe` to 1 (`DWORD`)

### Requirements
Administrator privileges are required to write to the registry key.

### The achieved persistence
Runs at least every 24 hours when nightly is set.
