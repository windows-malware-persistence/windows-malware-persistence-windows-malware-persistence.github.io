### Origin of the technique
Some executables under  `C:\WINDOWS\system32\oobe\` use a custom error handler command when they experience an error. 

### How to achieve persistence
Write a command to `c:\WINDOWS\Setup\Scripts\ErrorHandler.cmd`

### Requirements
Admin privileges to write to the file.

### The achieved persistence
When some programs in the `oobe` directory crash (e.g. run `setup.exe` w/o any arguments). The command will run with user privileges.
