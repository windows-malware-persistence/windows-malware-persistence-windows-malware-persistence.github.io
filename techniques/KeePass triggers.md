### Origin of the technique
Keepass allow automation for the user through 'triggers'.

### How to achieve persistence
Add a trigger that executes a command by writing to the Keepass config file. (`%appdata%\KeePass\KeePass.config.xml`)

### Requirements
User privileges are enough. Keepass should be closed when you write to the file.

### The achieved persistence
You can link execution to a KeePass event, such as starting up. User privileges.
