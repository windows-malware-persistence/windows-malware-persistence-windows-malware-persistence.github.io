### Origin of the technique
Windows terminal allows to set up profiles and to start it self on user login, all through the settings file.

### How to achieve persistence
Create a new profile in`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json`:
```json
{
	"closeOnExit": "graceful",
	"commandline": "C:\my\command.exe -w arguments",
	"guid": "{some-guid}",
	"hidden": true,
	"name": "mypersistence"
}
```
Change the `defaultProfile` to your guid
add `"startOnUserLogin": true`

### Requirements
Windows Terminal needs to be installed. User privileges are enough.

### The achieved persistence
Runs your command when the user logs in, or when the terminal is opened. It is destructive, as it does not launch the normal terminal. If you opt to add opening the normal terminal to the commandline, then it will open everytime you log in.
