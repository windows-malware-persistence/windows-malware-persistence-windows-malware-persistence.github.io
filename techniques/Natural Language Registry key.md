# Natural Language Registry key
### Origin of the technique
`SearchIndexer.exe` loads some DLLs specified in the registry.

### How to achieve persistence
Under any of the languages in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex\Language\<some language>` set the value of either `StemmerDLLPathOverride` or `WBDLLPathOverride` to the location of your DLL.

### Requirements
Admin privileges to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
SYSTEM privileges at log in.
