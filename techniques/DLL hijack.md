### Origin of the technique
Windows programs can use Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) to leverage functions that are used by many programs. If the DLL used by an executable that is ran by the system can be changed to the DLL provided by the attacker, this is called a DLL hijack.

### How to achieve persistence
There are many flavours of DLL hijacks, including:
- DLL replacement (simply replace the DLL file)
- DLL search order hijack (if the full path is not specified)
- Phantom DLL hijack (when a non-existing DLL is loaded)
But there are many more.


### Requirements
All techniques involve writing to a DLL file.

### The achieved persistence
Runs when the DLL is loaded by an application.
Non-destructive, because one can still perform the intended funcions by DLL proxying.
