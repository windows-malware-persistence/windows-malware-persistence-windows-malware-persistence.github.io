PowerShell loads the Get-Variable cmdlet when it is started.

### How to achieve persistence
Drop `%APPDATA%\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\Get-Variable.exe` so that PowerShell will load this cmdlet instead.

### Requirements
User privileges are enough to place the file.

### The achieved persistence
When the user opens PowerShell the code is executed.
