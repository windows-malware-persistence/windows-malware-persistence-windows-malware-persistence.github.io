# Browser extensions
### Origin of the technique
Browsers have extension that are active when the browser is running.

### How to achieve persistence
Add a extension to the default location.
- Chrome: 
`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions`
- Edge: `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Extensions\`
- Firefox: `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\YOUR_PROFILE.default\extensions\`

You can also change the link file on the Desktop to add a custom extension folder (see https://securityintelligence.com/posts/grandoreiro-malware-now-targeting-banks-in-spain/)

### Requirements
User privileges. Modern browser require confirmation by the user to add an extention.

### The achieved persistence
You can run some actions, but only within the browser context.
