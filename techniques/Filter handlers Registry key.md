# Filter handlers Registry key
### Origin of the technique
Windows allows for custom filters (`ifilters`) for files with custom file extensions. When searching in the Windows menu, these filters are applied.

### How to achieve persistence
Register a COM DLL for a file extension.
Now, there are two options:
Then, add the CLSID under `(Default)` in  `HKLM\Software\Classes\.<some extension>\PersistentHandler`
The second option is adding CLSID under `(Default)` in  `HKLM\Software\Classes\<some extension>file\CLSID`. Then, set if `(Default)` under `\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{CLSID}\PersistentHandler` to the COM CLSID.
### Requirements
Administrator privileges are required to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
When a new file with the extension is created, or when the file shows up in a search, the DLL is executed with System privileges.
