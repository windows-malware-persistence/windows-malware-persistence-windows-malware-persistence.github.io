### Origin of the technique
Print monitors are part of the Winodws operating system and convert print jobs to proper formats. The Windows Print Spooler Service or `spoolv.exe` allows to add DLLs as monitors.

### How to achieve persistence
To do it manually, write to registry. Under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors`, create a new key, with a subkey `Driver` containing the DLL location.

### Requirements
Administrator privileges required. Works with a regular DLL file.

### The achieved persistence
The DLL is load on boot with System privileges.
