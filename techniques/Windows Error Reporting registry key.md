### Origin of the technique
Windows Error Report (WER) allows to automatically attach a debugger when a program hangs.

### How to achieve persistence
Write the location of the executable to the key `Debugger` in  `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs\`

### Requirements
Administrator privileges are required to write to the registry.

### The achieved persistence
Executes when a program hangs, but does not work for me.
